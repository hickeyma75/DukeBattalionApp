    <h1>WELCOME TO THE JMU DUKE BATTALION APPLICATION</h1>
    <h2>We are so glad to finally have started this project</h2>
    <p>
    There are a couple main concerns with a project like this.  \n
    1-We need to have full support of the battalion for a project like this to be executed properly\n
    2-We need to ensure all around security with this application.\n
    3-We need to make sure that maintanence and security is a constant focus with this application.\n
    4-We want to make sure that this application gets a full range of use and everyone enjoys it.\n
    
    We hope you all like this application and we cant wait to hear about what you think of it.\n
    
    Very Respectfully,\n
    
    The JMU Duke Battalion Web and Mobile Application Team.\n
